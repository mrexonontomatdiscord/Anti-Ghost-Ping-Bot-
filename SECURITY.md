# Security Policy
### 1. Introduction
This security policy outlines the measures taken to ensure the safety, integrity, and privacy of users interacting with the Anti-Ghost-Ping Bot. We prioritize security and follow best practices to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, and data breaches.
### 2. User Data Protection
- We do not store user messages, pings, or interactions beyond the bot's runtime.
- Any user-identifying data (such as IDs) is stored temporarily in memory and cleared upon bot restart.
- No personal or sensitive data is collected, stored, or shared.

### 3. Access Control
- Only authorized bot developers can access logs or configurations.
- The bot operates using restricted permissions to minimize security risks.
- Administrative commands (such as whitelisting) are limited to authorized users.

### 4. Secure Authentication
- The bot’s authentication token is stored in an .env file, ensuring it is never hardcoded in the bot’s source code.
- Developers should regularly rotate API keys and use strong, unique passwords.

### 5. Hosting & Server Security
- The bot is hosted on trusted cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, Railway, AWS).
- Best practices for server security include:- Keeping dependencies up-to-date.
- Restricting access to the bot’s hosting environment.
- Monitoring logs for suspicious activity.


### 6. Vulnerability Management
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported via GitHub Issues or direct communication with the development team.
- The bot undergoes regular updates to patch security risks and improve functionality.

### 7. Abuse Prevention
- The bot does not execute dangerous commands or allow unrestricted permissions.
- Anti-spam measures prevent excessive command usage.
- Misuse (such as mass ghost-pinging) may result in automated restrictions.

### 8. Responsible Disclosure
If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them immediately to the development team to ensure a swift resolution.
